## **Description**

The purpose of this assignment was to create a Content Management System for a person to view various data sets of the internal structure of an organization (departments, roles & employees).  The user should be able to use the command line to choose various options to both view and update different data sets.  I used MYSQL, Inquirer, and console.table to create this project.  Inquirer is great to use for asking the user questions and pulling in that data, while console.table makes taking data and converting it into a table far simpler.  I had originally not used console.table and my code was a nightmare to look at becuase I was using so many variables, but console.table essentially let me one-line things.
